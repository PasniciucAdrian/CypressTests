# ✅ Cypress Test Project – Navigation and Cross-Domain Verification

[![Cypress](https://img.shields.io/badge/tested%20with-Cypress-4fc08d.svg)](https://www.cypress.io/)

This project demonstrates a simple **end-to-end (E2E)** test using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), focused on navigating between domains and verifying UI behavior.

---

## Purpose of the Test


The goal is to simulate a real user journey that includes:

- Visiting the official Cypress homepage: `https://www.cypress.io`
- Accepting cookie preferences (if the popup appears)
- Clicking on the "Docs" link which redirects the user to another domain: `https://docs.cypress.io`
- Verifying that the **Docs page loads successfully** and the Cypress logo (`.navbar__brand`) is visible

This test showcases **cross-origin navigation** using `cy.origin()` introduced in Cypress v10+.

---

## What Is Being Tested?


| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Visit homepage | Page loads without errors |
| 2 | Handle cookie popup | Button is visible and clicked |
| 3 | Click Docs link | Switches to `docs.cypress.io` |
| 4 | Wait for Docs page to load | Cypress logo is present on screen |

## Getting Started


### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Open the Cypress Test Runner (GUI mode)

```bash
npm run cy:open
```

Or run the test in headless mode:

```bash
npm run cy:run
```

## Sample Test File – `navigate-to-docs.cy.js`


```javascript
describe('Navigate to Docs and verify element on a different domain', () => {
  it('Visits the site and accesses the Docs page', () => {
    cy.visit('https://www.cypress.io/');

    // Accept cookies if the popup is visible
    cy.get('button:contains("Accept All")', { timeout: 10000 }).then(($btn) => {
      if ($btn.is(':visible')) {
        cy.wrap($btn).click();
      }
    });

    // Navigate to Docs (different domain)
    cy.get('#dropdownDocs')
      .should('have.attr', 'href')
      .then((href) => {
        cy.origin('https://docs.cypress.io', () => {
          cy.visit('/app/get-started/why-cypress');
          cy.get('.navbar__brand').should('exist');
        });
      });
  });
});
```
